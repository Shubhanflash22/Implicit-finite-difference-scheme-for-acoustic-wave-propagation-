## Project Overview

This project models acoustic wave propagation using implicit finite difference and central difference schemes. By simulating waves at different propagation speeds using the Richter wavelet, the project provides insights into numerical stability, wave behavior, and computational methods for acoustic modeling.

Key components include:

* Implementation of implicit and central finite difference schemes.
* Simulation of wave propagation at four different speeds.
* Visualization of wave propagation using MATLAB.

## Dataset / Inputs

* **Input Wavelet:** Richter wavelet used for generating initial acoustic signals.
* **Wave Propagation Speeds:** Simulations conducted for four different speeds to analyze numerical behavior.
* **Grid Parameters:** Spatial and temporal discretization parameters for the finite difference schemes.

## Features

* **Implicit Finite Difference Scheme:** Ensures numerical stability for simulating wave propagation.
* **Central Difference Scheme:** Provides baseline comparison for wave behavior.
* **Visualization:** Matlab scripts generate plots of wave propagation at different speeds.
* **MATLAB Integration:** MATLAB scripts used for additional visualization and analysis.
